# Python Number Guessing Game

A simple interactive number guessing game implemented in Python where players try to guess a randomly selected number within a user-defined range.

## Description

This is a command-line number guessing game with the following features:

1. Players can select their own range for the number (from A to B, where A and B are integers)
2. The system randomly selects a number within that range
3. Players must guess the number in as few attempts as possible
4. The game provides feedback after each guess

## How to Play

1. Run the game
2. Enter the lower bound (A) of the range
3. Enter the upper bound (B) of the range
4. Start guessing the number
5. After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess was too high or too low
6. Keep guessing until you find the correct number
7. The game will show your total number of guesses
